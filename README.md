<h1>Come To Cork</h1>

I had the challenge of developing a dynamic front end project, with custom written Javascript, HTML and CSS code and cosisting of one or more HTML pages.
I have created a made up tourism site for domestic and international tourists planning a trip to Cork, Ireland. This website will use the Google maps API, so users can interact with the site and have a better understanding of where things are located.
I also implemented a corona virus API, which allows potential visitors to get a live update on the number of cases and deaths in Ireland due to covid-19. This will allow users to make an informed decision on whether it is safe to visit Ireland or not. 
They will also be guided on the Government restrictions in place as every country differs In terms of the laws and regulations.

## USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

Consumers who are contemplating a potential trip away invest time in researching potential destinations through reviews, experiences content blogs and search engines. A holiday is experiential rather than materialistic so it's not an impulse decision in most cases. People want to know they are going to get a unique new experience on their next holiday. There is also a trend in tourism that visitors have a cultural appreication for hidden gems and living like a local. 
I considered all of these factors and trends when designing my website. 

The key goals for Come to Cork are:
 
1. Promote Cork City as a tourist destination.

2. Allow users/potential city break tourists to make an informed decision and include cork as part of their conderation set when thinking of a city break away.

    ### Wireframes 
I used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/) to build the wireframes. I created mockups for desktop, tablet and mobile viewports so i could have an idea of what my website would look like and a plan i could follow to avoid scope creep.
