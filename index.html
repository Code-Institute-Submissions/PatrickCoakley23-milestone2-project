               <h4>History</h4>
               <p>
               Built on an island enclosed by the River Lee, this ancient merchant city is steeped in history and culture. Cork Is known as ‘the rebel county’, and you can explore it’s rebellious nature by visiting places like the public museum in Fitzgerald’s park, the Cork City Gaol , which during the War of Independence, acted as a prison for republican women prisoners, including Constance  Markievicz, the first ever woman elected to the British Parliament. 
Just from strolling the grand Georgian avenues or the cramped 17th-century alleyways, every turn you make you’ll feel a bit of Corks fascinating and turbulent History.

               <h4>Irelands Food Capital</h4>
               <p>
               Since the effects of the recession of 2008, Cork has revitalized itself as a vibrant city with a diverse food culture. The city has come out from Dublin’s’ shadow to be the food capital of Ireland.Eater.com has listed Cork among their top 20 cities in the world to eat in 2020. 
"With the beloved and ancient English Market as the town’s traditional heart, what has grown up around it is a delicious and diverse counterpoint, ranging from a tiny south Indian ayurvedic cafe to sourdough pizza, from Japanese food — both casual and starry — to Middle Eastern cafes, and from impeccable fish and chips to an almost religious craft-beer obsession.

               <h4>Music & Culture</h4>
               <p>
               Cork is a great city for the ‘craic’, with the pub at the heart of it. McCurtain Street, Washington Street and Oliver Plunkett Street are the main places to have a bit of a bar crawl dipping in and out of different places. Cork has a hopping craft beer scene with three micro-brew bars, Bier Haus, Franciscan Well and Rising Sons. Cork has plenty to offer from cosy pubs, old man pubs, rock bars to toe-tapping traditional Irish music gigs.
The city that raised the greatest guitarist in the world, Rory Gallagher, and home of the world-famous Guinness Jazz festival, Cork is very much a musical city. Pop into the Siné or An Spailpín Fánach for traditional Irish, while Coughlan’s and The Oliver Plunkett host more wide-ranging live music scenes.

               <h4>The Wild Atlantic Way</h4>
               <p>
               Cork is Ireland’s Largest county, and it is not an exaggeration to claim it features one of the most scenic regions in the world, West Cork. West Cork anecdotally begins at Kinsale and ends at the most westerly point of the Beara Peninsula right on the Kerry border. 
The further west you head, the more rugged and "wild west" the landscape becomes. West Cork is characterised by little ports, bays, inlets and harbour’s, quaint colourful villages and Towns, and friendly people who are “salt of the earth”. 
If you are looking to escape the cosmopolitan city of Cork, a trip to West Cork wouldn’t go a miss.

                           <p>Following Government guidelines, everyone is asked to stay local, in order to slow the spread of Covid-19. This means people should travel within their own county</p>
                           <p>If you are arriving in Ireland from another country apart from Northern Ireland, by law you are required to fill in a form called the 'Covid-19 Passenger Locator Form'. You'll also be asked to self isolate for 14 days.</p>
                           <p>Please be aware that many of the businesses and tourist sites mentioned on this website may infact be closed due to covid-19, but bear with us as we continue to update this page as and when we receive further information.</p>
